<p>I am a Freshman Admission Counselor.  I am so excited to have the opportunity to introduce prospective students to the dynamic education, experiences and community here at USF. </p>
<p>Located in the heart of San Francisco, the university is centrally placed in one of the most innovative, philanthropic and culturally diverse cities in the world.  As a native to the Bay Area I think there is no better place to go to school.</p>
<p>As a Jesuit institution the University of San Francisco offers a core curriculum that engages and challenges all students. As an alumni of a Jesuit university I can confidently say that this type of well-rounded education will not only benefit the student during their undergraduate career but will stay with them long past graduation. </p>
<p>I encourage you to come visit the community here at the University of San Francisco and please feel free to contact me with any questions!</p>
<p>Go Dons!</p>
